# Fluff Frontend

A Svelte-based frontend for my small webserver (Java Spring Backend)

Intended as a project for me to learn how to use Svelte

## Current features:
- To do list
  - uses a postgres db in the backend to store tasks
- Wordle copy
  - uses a word list that is managed by the webserver
